# Javascript Templating && MUSTACHE && FLEXBOX 

## Javascript Templating

Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

## Mustache

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.
It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.
mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating. And, since mustache supports various languages, we don’t need a separate templating system on the server side.

`Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });`
In the above, we see two braces around {{ name }}. This is Mustache syntax to show that it is a placeholder. When Mustache compiles this, it will look for the ‘name’ property in the object we pass in, and replace {{ name }} with the actual value, e,g, “Sherlynn”.

# Flexbox

`flex-direction`
This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.

* row (default): left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl
* row-reverse: right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl
* column: same as row but top to bottom
* column-reverse: same as row-reverse but bottom to top

`flex-wrap`
By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.
`.container {`
`  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;`
`}`

* nowrap (default): all flex items will be on one line
* wrap: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.
* wrap-reverse: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top.
